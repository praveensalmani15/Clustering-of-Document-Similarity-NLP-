# Clustering-of-Document-Similarity-NLP-
Clustering of Document Similarity by using NLP 

## Project Description

This project focuses on clustering similar documents using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The primary goal is to analyze and group documents based on their textual content, allowing for better organization and retrieval of information.

### Key Components:
- **Feature Extraction**: The project utilizes various feature extraction methods, including binary count, frequency count, and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). These techniques transform the raw text into a structured format suitable for analysis.
  
- **Clustering Algorithm**: The K-Means clustering algorithm is employed to categorize documents into distinct clusters. This allows us to identify patterns and similarities within the dataset.

- **Data Visualization**: To enhance interpretability, the clusters are visualized in a 2D space using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This visualization helps in understanding the distribution and relationships between different document clusters.

### Applications:
The clustering of documents can be beneficial in various applications, such as:
- Organizing large sets of text data for better accessibility.
- Improving search functionalities in document management systems.
- Analyzing trends and themes within a collection of documents.
